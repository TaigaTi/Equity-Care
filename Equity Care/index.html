                            <h3>Who</h3>
                              <p>Many persons around the world lack access to healthcare because of where they may live. Their address prohibits basic health checkups and doctor visits and means that these necessities become far-fetched for these individuals. These disadvantages mean that persons tend to have several health issues that remain undiagnosed and therefore untreated. Equity Care hopes to alleviate the number of persons who may be faced with this unfortunate reality.</p>

                            <h3>What</h3>
                            <p>A health disparity can be defined as a difference in health between persons that can be attributed to one or more of the following factors:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Social Disadvantages such as race, ethnicity and gender</li>
                                <li>Economic Disadvantages such as lack of income and expensive health care</li>
                                <li>Environmental Disadvantages such as lack of easy access to a medical center or health care facility</li>

                            <h3>Where</h3>
                            <p>All over the world, health disparities tend to occur in rural and urban areas. Any health care services that may be provided nearby are usually far too expensive for these persons of lower income. As a result, many persons will choose to neglect their own health by putting off doctor visits and instead put that money into putting food on the table.</p>

                            <h3>When</h3>
                            <p>Health disparities have been a prevalent issues in our society for as long as history can remember. It is well known that in the days of slavery and shortly thereafter, persons of color were neglected and their health was not of major concern. As a result, the mortality rate for persons of colour were unbelievably high. Over approxiamately 17 years, the death rate for African Americans has declined by about 25% , mainly for those over the age of 65. However, disparities in health still remain a growing concern in today's environment. In the year 2020, the Corona Virus Pandemic struck the world, raising concerns about health and well-being through the roof. This virus is known to target especially those with underlying health conditions and because many persons neglecting their health may suffer from these conditions, this calls for immediate action.</p>

                          <h3>Why</h3>
                          <p>Unfortunately, distance is one of the greatest barriers in terms of access to healthcare and as such, constributes significantly to health disparities among persons who may live in areas without easy access to this necessity. This may result in many persons leaving their respective illnesses undiagnosed and untreated as they simply have no where to go to seek help. We at Equity Care are hoping to alleviate this issue through a 100% online health center. </p>
